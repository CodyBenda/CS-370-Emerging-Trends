**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
In this project, we were given starter-code for a treasure hunting game. Using this code, we were told to create a Q-Algorithm. This algorithm would loop through the game and train a pirate agent to play the game.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer Scientists work within the theoretical foundations of computers. While they generally design software and hardware systems for most things in our modern world, recently a lot of their work has been done on artificial intelligence. These scientists are the ones who develop the algorithms and architectures that enable any of the ever-growing uses of artificial intelligence, from self-driving cars to medical diagnostics. Their contribution to this field enhances our lives by automating tasks and augmenting our own intelligence. 

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
Computer scientists tend to break down problems into the core issues, work on solutions to each one, and bring these solutions together for a full solution. Using a level abstraction to focus on the essentials helps identify the core problem. They also tend to apply a level of logical rigor to their problem-solving, which helps devise efficient solutions to the problems. This logical thinking also helps them rapidly iterate over any solutions that they come up with, so they can see the best way to implement these solutions.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
Computer scientists have a responsibility to prioritize information security for uses, to ensure their privacy. They also have a responsibility to avoid bias that can propagate discrimination against marginalized groups. The societal impacts of their systems need to be considered, and a level of transparency so that users can build trust with the organization that is developing the system.

They also have ethical responsibilities to the organization they work for, such as avoiding misrepresenting what their systems do and how they work. They also need to respect confidentiality and intellectual property agreements. Ultimately, they need to balance their responsibilities to the organization with their own personal ethics, up to and including calling out unethical practices in the organization that go beyond their ethical limits.
